# control-system-of-culvert-inspection-robot
At present, most of the culverts in Indonesia potentially full of
garbages, especially in the city of Surabaya. According to the Dinas
Pekerjaan Umum Binamarga dan Pematusan, the current condition of
culverts in Surabaya is mostly filled with garbage and sediment. The main
obstacle in the effort to maintain culverts in Surabaya is that several
culverts are troublesome to reach by workers because of the narrow size,
deep, and filled with garbages. Therefore, in this paper, a culverts
inspection robot with sophisticated control and monitoring system are
needed with a wireless-based data communication media. The system has
manually remote controlling mode and semi-autonomous mode for
avoiding obstacles. The system is implemented in LabView using myRio
embedded platform, utilizing FPGA to achieve real-time performance.
From the testing that has been done, the results are in the form of a
monitoring system with data output in theform of video streaming with a
maximum range of communication to the computer server 69meters and
an obstacle avoidance system with ultrasonic sensor accuracy that can
detect distances of at least 3 cm and a maximum of 400 cm.
